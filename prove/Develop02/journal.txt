 How did you see the hand of God in your life today? 
 I saw the hand of God when I was able to focus on my scripture study for a few minutes this morning. Recently I have been feeling that I am off-track and need to re-center myself spiritually. It was rejuvenating.

 What helped you feel the Spirit today? 
 I tried to avoid music that was loud and charged. Some days I can listen to that music and still remain spiritually focused, but recently that hasn't been the case. I listened to hymns and sonatas instead and felt much better. I did sneak in a bit of Brett Young though...

 Was there a particular scripture that stood out to you in your study today? Write about why. 
 Nephi 11, where Nephi has the vision. It was a good reminder about how we are all in danger of falling into the Pride Cycle and experiencing its terrible consequences.
